Loftwah The Beatsmiff is a Hip Hop producer based in Perth, Western Australia. He began making beats in 2005 with his first release being ‘Such Iz Life’, an album by the rapper known as JR, only being introduced because of the effort of their mutual friend Andrew Wakely, who made sure Loftwah kept making music. Andrew gave JR. a CD of Loftwah’s beats only for it to be left in a taxi, with one of JR’s friends saying “who cares, it’s not like he’s going to be the next Scott Storch”. Andrew, determined to make sure these beats were heard delivered a copy to JR and made sure he listened to it.
